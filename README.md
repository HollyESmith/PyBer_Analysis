# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

PyBer is a ride sharing app company; I was initially tasked with creating visualizations of rideshare data to help understand the correlation between ridership and fare data. The purpose of this new analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type with a goal of helping to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

I created the following overview summary by combining ride and city data:

Data was collected from January to early May of 2019.

A review of this data demonstrates several findings:

  •	Urban cities have the highest ridership (68.4% of the total number of rides).

  •	Urban cities also have the largest number of drivers (81% of total drivers).

  •	Suburban cities have less than half the number of drivers as urban cities, but more than twice the average fare per driver.

  •	Rural cities have the fewest number of drivers (2.6 % of total number of drivers) but the highest average fare per ride and per driver.

  •	The volume of rides in urban cities produces the largest amount revenue, despite the average fare per driver is the smallest.

Total fare by city type visualized:

This visualization tells us:

1.	All three city types have a bump in total fares in late February and a decline in March. Rural cities show the steadiest income stream over the four months that data was collected.

2.	Suburban cities see a larger uptick in ridership in mid to late April than urban or rural cities.

## Summary

Based on this analysis, my business recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types are:
1.	Advertising in urban areas may increase ridership. PyBer currently employs more drivers than rides provided; if PyBer’s goal is to keep the large number of employees, it will be necessary to increase ridership.

2.	I believe the suburban sector has the most potential for positive growth; I recommend advertising in this sector as well.

3.	I encourage PyBer to expand the dataset to 12 months for further analysis. Data for an entire year would provide more information on ridership trends, such as peak summer months, and would strategically benefit the company.
